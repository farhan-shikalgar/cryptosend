# Cryptosend

Send Crypto with a gif verfication

Krypt Send is an innovative and playful approach to sending cryptocurrency transactions using a GIF-based interface. Traditional cryptocurrency transactions often involve complex addresses and QR codes, which can be intimidating for newcomers and sometimes prone to errors.

With Krypt Send, we're simplifying the process by incorporating GIFs and making cryptocurrency transactions more intuitive and engaging.
